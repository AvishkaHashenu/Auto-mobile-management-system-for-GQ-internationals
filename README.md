#### Brief Description of Project - 

This project is based on an automobile management system that is going to develop using the client's requirements. GQ Internationals has mainly B2B sales that sells automobiles parts to their clients through social media and other agents.  As the client currently using a manual-based system as developers we decided to come up with an automated system that is capable of the current situation. By automating the system, it is easier to move more forward with the other companies and achieve the goals very accurately.
